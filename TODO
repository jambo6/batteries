# Add random states to PipelineCompiler splitting

# Put the ignite trainer in here and make a non-ignite trainer

# Output model and datasets and allow for further performance evaluation (for example full ROC)

# Enable pipeline application to dataframes, returning split dataframes.

# Make the Pipeline be a train test process pipeline.
    - Add more options for splitting (train/test only or even no split).
